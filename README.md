Background
Considering the growing number of local businesses on a small scale, especially those which are initiated by women fail to get recognition due to various factors affecting their livelihood and family. There are many skilful women but just fail to find an opportunity in that field.
Introduction to Application
With Standoutloud, our application, we try to bring all the small-scale businesses at one place and do justice to their service and give a recognition to them. With help of Standoutloud, the business owners can post about them, kind of work they do and the service they provide. All this information will be visible to the common users like us, who can reach out to them if they want to and get their work done. This helps in local level recognition of the business and the word spreads out. If anyone wants to enrol for employment in any of the business, he can do that by contacting the owner where vacancies are available.
Moreover, if any professional organization/individual wants to fund/invest in any of the business, they can contact and take the process ahead.
